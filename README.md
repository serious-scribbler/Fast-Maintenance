Fast Maintenance is simple maintenance message with
countdown timer. It displays the time until a specific date.
Keep in mind that it will start counting upwards if
the selected end date is exceeded.

You can set your end date by editing the script in the beginning
of the index.html file. There are variables for the year, month, day,
hour minute and second of your end date.
